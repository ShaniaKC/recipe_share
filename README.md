### Recipe Sharing Platform

#### Frontend (React + TypeScript):

#### Key Features:

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Use JWT for secure authentication.

2. **Recipe Feed:**

   - Display a feed of recently added recipes on the homepage.
   - Include features like infinite scrolling or pagination.

3. **Recipe Search and Filters:**

   - Implement a search bar for users to find specific recipes.
   - Add filters based on categories, ingredients, or difficulty levels.

4. **Recipe Details:**

   - Create a detailed page for each recipe with ingredients, steps, and user comments.
   - Allow users to rate recipes.

5. **User Profiles:**

   - Provide user profiles with a list of their submitted recipes, saved recipes, and ratings.

6. **Add/Edit/Delete Recipes:**

   - Allow users to contribute by adding new recipes.
   - Implement functionality to edit and delete their own recipes.

7. **Save and Favorites:**

   - Enable users to save recipes to their favorites or create custom lists.

8. **Responsive Design:**

   - Ensure the application is responsive for different devices.

9. **Error Handling:**

   - Implement error handling for various scenarios.

10. **Logout Functionality:**
    - Allow users to log out.

#### Backend (Node.js with Express or Python with Flask):

#### Key Features:

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Create endpoints for user registration and login.
   - Generate and verify JWTs for authentication.

2. **Recipe CRUD API:**

   - Set up API endpoints for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting recipes.
   - Implement authorization to ensure users can only manipulate their recipes.

3. **Database Integration:**

   - Use a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user information and recipes.
   - Connect the backend to the database and handle data operations.

4. **Middleware:**

   - Implement middleware for authentication and error handling.
   - Handle CORS and other necessary middleware.

5. **Testing:**

   - Write unit tests for controllers, services, and authentication.

6. **Documentation:**

   - Provide API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.

7. **Deploy:**
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.

### Project Structure:

#### Frontend:

- **src/components:** React components (e.g., RecipeFeed, RecipeDetails, UserProfile).
- **src/services:** Functions for interacting with backend APIs.
- **src/utils:** Utility functions for authentication, error handling, etc.
- **src/styles:** CSS or SCSS files for styling.

#### Backend:

- **app/controllers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests and provide responses.
- **app/models:** Define data models for users and recipes.
- **app/routes:** Define API routes for authentication and recipe management.
- **app/services:** Implement business logic and interact with the database.
- **app/**init**.py (Flask) or src/index.js (Express):** Initialize the application.
- **run.py (Flask) or src/index.js (Express):** Script to run the application.

### Getting Started:

1. Set up a new React project with TypeScript for the frontend.
2. Create the necessary components and services for user authentication and recipe management.
3. Design and implement the UI for the recipe feed, recipe details, user profiles, and forms.
4. Test the frontend thoroughly, ensuring a smooth user experience.

For the backend:

1. Set up a new Node.js with Express or Python with Flask project for the backend.
2. Implement user authentication routes and logic.
3. Create API routes for recipe management, ensuring proper authorization.
4. Connect the backend to a database for data storage.
5. Test the backend, including authentication and recipe-related endpoints.
6. Deploy both the frontend and backend to a cloud platform.

This project allows you to showcase your skills in building a collaborative web application, handling user-generated
content, and managing a database. Customize the features based on your interests and learning goals.
